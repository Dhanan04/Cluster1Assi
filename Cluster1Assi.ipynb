    "- Advantage of K mean Clustering\n",
    "K-Means is relatively simple to understand and implement. It's computationally efficient, making it suitable for large datasets. K-Means can handle large datasets efficiently due to its linear time complexity with respect to the number of data points. The cluster assignments and centroids provide a straightforward way to interpret and visualize the results. K-Means is guaranteed to converge to a solution, even though it may be a local minimum. The results can be improved by running K-Means multiple times with different initializations. K-Means works well with datasets where clusters are relatively spherical and have similar sizes. Various initialization methods are available to improve the quality of the final clustering results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Limitations of K-Means Clustering \n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means results can vary depending on the initial positions of centroids. This sensitivity can lead to different local optima. K-Means requires specifying the number of clusters K beforehand, which might not be known or evident in some cases. K-Means assumes that clusters are spherical and have equal sizes. It struggles with clusters of different shapes or sizes. K-Means struggles with datasets that contain non-convex clusters or clusters with complex shapes. Outliers can significantly influence the positions of centroids and result in suboptimal clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means can create empty clusters if data points are too far from any centroid. It's sensitive to noisy data and can produce less meaningful clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other clustering techniques, K-Means has a clear advantage in terms of simplicity and efficiency. However, it might not perform as well as more advanced techniques in cases where clusters have irregular shapes, different sizes, or when the number of clusters is not known beforehand. Techniques like hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models, can address some of the limitations of K-Means by accommodating non-spherical clusters, varying cluster sizes, and outliers."

    "\n",
    "- Elbow method : The elbow method involves plotting the within-cluster sum of squared distances (WCSS) against the number of clusters (K). WCSS measures the sum of squared distances between each data point and its assigned centroid within the cluster. As K increases, WCSS tends to decrease, as more centroids result in smaller within-cluster distances. However, at a certain point, the rate of decrease slows down, creating an \"elbow\" in the plot. The point where the decrease starts to slow down is often considered a reasonable estimate for the optimal number of clusters. \n",

    "- Silhouette Score : \n",
    "The silhouette score measures how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). It ranges from -1 to 1, where a higher score indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters. The silhouette score can help you find the number of clusters that maximizes the overall cohesion and separation of clusters."
